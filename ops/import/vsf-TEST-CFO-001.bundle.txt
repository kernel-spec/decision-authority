Board Decision Package: Breakeven in 12 Months Without Breaking the Growth Narrative

Company: B2B SaaS (~$9M ARR, ~74% gross margin)
Decision Date: 2026-02-23
Sponsor: CFO
Audience: Board, CEO, Exec Team

1) Executive Summary

We will reach breakeven within 12 months using a governed, trigger-based operating system that preserves the growth narrative through explicit guardrails on retention and pipeline health. The plan shifts the company from “growth at any cost” to “efficient growth,” using Rule of 40 and leading indicators to support external credibility while we tighten spend and improve unit economics.

What we are asking the Board to approve today
	1.	Adopt FCF breakeven as the primary definition (with EBITDA as a secondary lens).
	2.	Approve the trigger + gating system (fail-closed) that automatically constrains hiring and discretionary spend when critical signals degrade.
	3.	Approve a phased execution plan:
	•	Phase 1 (0–30 days): stop-the-bleed + instrumentation + fast savings
	•	Phase 2 (31–120 days): GTM efficiency + retention lift + pricing discipline
	•	Phase 3 (121–365 days): scale what works within gated budgets to land at breakeven

Outcome
	•	Breakeven (FCF and/or EBITDA) by month 12 using ranges (no false precision)
	•	Maintain credible growth story via guardrails: NRR floor, pipeline coverage, gross margin, and Rule of 40 trend

2) Context and Mandate

The Board mandate is clear: achieve breakeven in 12 months without undermining the growth narrative. For a ~$9M ARR SaaS at ~74% GM, the path is operationally feasible if we:
	•	Protect retention and product quality (prevent revenue leakage)
	•	Improve GTM efficiency (better payback, tighter ICP)
	•	Rationalize spend with disciplined gates (no ad-hoc cuts that harm the long-term)

3) Breakeven Definition and Reporting

We propose FCF breakeven as the primary definition because it reflects cash reality. However, cash can be volatile due to collections and working capital timing, so we will also report EBITDA breakeven as a consistent operating view.

Definition (FCF): 3-month average of (Operating Cash Flow – Capex) ≥ 0
Definition (EBITDA): 3-month average EBITDA ≥ 0
We will manage to a trajectory with bands (e.g., within ±$40–$50k of target band is considered on-track).

4) Operating System: Triggers and Gates (Fail-Closed)

We will run the company with explicit triggers (formulas + thresholds + windows + pass/fail actions). The system is designed to fail-closed: if critical triggers fail, the company automatically shifts into defensive mode until two consecutive PASS cycles.

Critical guardrails (non-negotiable)
	•	Runway floor (>= 15 months target band; < 12 months = FAIL)
	•	Retention floor (NRR >= 105% target band; < 100% = FAIL)
	•	Gross margin floor (>= 72% target band; < 70% = FAIL)
	•	Breakeven trajectory (FCF or EBITDA 3-mo avg vs target band)

Growth narrative guardrails
	•	Rule of 40: keep trend >= ~30% band where feasible
	•	Pipeline coverage: maintain >= ~3.0x next-quarter coverage band
	•	CAC payback: stay within <= ~15 months band; failing segments are cut or reworked

What gates do
	•	Hiring gate: net-new headcount allowed only when critical triggers are PASS; otherwise backfills only (and retention-critical exceptions)
	•	GTM spend gate: scale only where pipeline + payback are healthy; otherwise cut lowest ROI channels and tighten qualification
	•	Product/R&D gate: protect retention-critical roadmap; pause non-core initiatives during cost stress
	•	Vendor gate: renegotiate and constrain non-labor spend if runway deteriorates

5) Plan of Record: 3 Phases

Phase 1 (0–30 days): Stop-the-bleed + Instrumentation

Goals: immediate cost control without harming retention; establish metrics, definitions, and cadence.
Actions:
	•	Implement trigger dashboard and weekly operating review
	•	Freeze non-essential spend; require ROI for new vendors >$5k/month
	•	Identify 10–20% discretionary savings from tools, contractors, and low-ROI marketing tests
	•	Confirm baseline: burn, runway, ARR bridge, GM drivers, churn reasons

Deliverable: Board-ready baseline model (base/downside/upside) with variance bands.

Phase 2 (31–120 days): GTM Efficiency + Retention + Pricing Discipline

Goals: improve unit economics and reduce revenue leakage; preserve growth narrative via leading indicators.
Actions:
	•	Tighten ICP, enforce qualification, rebalance SDR/AE capacity to pipeline reality
	•	Reduce discounting variance; implement pricing/packaging governance
	•	Launch churn war-room if NRR trends toward WATCH/FAIL
	•	Drive CAC payback down through conversion improvements and segment focus
	•	Infra/COGS optimization roadmap to protect GM

Deliverable: demonstrated improvements in payback, pipeline coverage, and NRR trajectory.

Phase 3 (121–365 days): Scale Within Gates to Land at Breakeven

Goals: selective reinvestment in proven channels and product initiatives; reach breakeven by month 12.
Actions:
	•	Scale only segments/channels with PASS on payback and coverage
	•	Invest in expansion motions where NRR supports it
	•	Maintain defensive readiness: if triggers fail, automatically constrain spend/hiring

Deliverable: breakeven achieved with stable retention and credible growth narrative metrics.

6) Key Risks and Mitigations
	1.	Retention erosion from cost actions
	•	Mitigation: retention floor trigger; protect CS/Product capacity; churn war-room.
	2.	Pipeline shortfall jeopardizes growth narrative
	•	Mitigation: pipeline coverage trigger; re-segment; focus spend on proven ROI.
	3.	Cash volatility masks underlying trend
	•	Mitigation: use 3-month averages; pair EBITDA with runway trigger; stress cases.
	4.	Over-cutting reduces future growth capacity
	•	Mitigation: gates allow selective investment when PASS; keep a capped experiment budget.
	5.	Data quality/definitions cause “false signals”
	•	Mitigation: data SLA; enforce CRM hygiene; standard metric definitions in outcome contract.

7) Decisions Required Today
	1.	Approve FCF breakeven as primary definition (EBITDA as secondary).
	2.	Approve the trigger thresholds (bands) and fail-closed gating rules.
	3.	Approve the operating cadence and owner accountability model.
	4.	Approve Phase 1 actions (instrumentation + immediate discretionary savings + vendor controls).

8) What the Board Should Expect Next
	•	Weekly dashboard highlights (runway, pipeline, spend vs budget)
	•	Monthly close package: trigger status, forecast ranges (base/downside/upside), gate exception log
	•	Quarterly: trajectory vs breakeven plan, efficiency narrative (Rule of 40, NRR, CAC payback)

# Runtime Enforcement Contract v1 (CFO) — vsf-TEST-CFO-001

## A) Enforcement Contract v1

### A1. Ingress: Required Artifacts (Fail-Closed)
The Worker MUST ingest exactly four artifacts as JSON objects:
1) `micro_case`
2) `trigger_spec`
3) `gating_rules`
4) `outcome_contract`

**Checks (deterministic):**
- RUNTIME-A1-1: All four top-level keys exist and are non-null.
  - If missing any: reason_code = CFO-01, outcome = NEEDS_INPUT
- RUNTIME-A1-2: Each artifact parses as valid JSON and matches expected root shape:
  - `micro_case.micro_case` object exists
  - `trigger_spec.trigger_spec` object exists
  - `gating_rules.gating_rules` object exists
  - `outcome_contract.outcome_contract` object exists
  - If invalid/parse error: reason_code = CFO-02, outcome = REJECTED
  - If wrong root shape: reason_code = CFO-03, outcome = REJECTED

### A2. Units, Windows, and Cadence Consistency (No Ambiguity)
All triggers and success criteria MUST be evaluable with explicit units, windows, and cadence.

**Global unit policy:**
- Money: USD (allow "$" as alias, normalized to USD)
- Percent: percent (0–100 scale unless explicitly labeled as ratio)
- Multipliers: "x"
- Time: months / weeks / days where stated

**Checks:**
- RUNTIME-A2-1: Every trigger has:
  - `id`, `name`, `formula`, `threshold.pass/watch/fail`, `measurement_window`, and at least one action in `action_if_pass` and `action_if_fail`.
  - If missing: reason_code = CFO-04, outcome = REJECTED
- RUNTIME-A2-2: Every threshold statement must be machine-normalizable into a comparator set (>=, <=, <, >) and numeric value(s) with unit.
  - If not normalizable (e.g., free text without numbers): reason_code = CFO-05, outcome = REJECTED
- RUNTIME-A2-3: Window alignment:
  - If trigger declares "Trailing 3-month average" then formula must reference 3mo_avg (or equivalent) OR be explicitly mapped in normalization rules.
  - If mismatch: reason_code = CFO-06, outcome = REJECTED
- RUNTIME-A2-4: Outcome success_criteria units must match trigger units when same metric name is used (e.g., NRR percent, GrossMargin percent).
  - If mismatch: reason_code = CFO-07, outcome = REJECTED

### A3. Variance Requirement (Bands Over Points)
“No fake precision” is mandatory: all targets MUST be expressed as ranges/bands.

**Checks:**
- RUNTIME-A3-1: In `outcome_contract.success_criteria`, every target is `target_range` with two numbers [min,max].
  - If any metric uses a single point: reason_code = CFO-08, outcome = REJECTED
- RUNTIME-A3-2: In `micro_case.constraints_and_non_negotiables.non_negotiables`, presence of “No fake precision” requirement is treated as binding:
  - If missing from micro_case (unexpected): reason_code = CFO-09, outcome = NEEDS_INPUT

### A4. Breakeven Metric Selection Rule (FCF Primary)
Primary breakeven is FCF; EBITDA is secondary; both are reported.

**Checks:**
- RUNTIME-A4-1: `outcome_contract.breakeven_definition_selected.preferred` must equal "FCF breakeven" and `alternate` must include "EBITDA breakeven".
  - If absent or different: reason_code = CFO-10, outcome = REJECTED
- RUNTIME-A4-2: Triggers must include both T1 (FCF) and T2 (EBITDA).
  - If missing either: reason_code = CFO-11, outcome = REJECTED
- RUNTIME-A4-3: If cash_on_hand is unknown (micro_case baseline has range but not point), runway trigger T4 cannot be computed deterministically unless actual `cash_balance` data is provided at runtime.
  - If runtime evaluation requested without cash_balance input: reason_code = CFO-12, outcome = NEEDS_INPUT

### A5. Trigger Rules: Evaluation, Normalization, and State
#### A5.1 Trigger State Machine
Each trigger evaluates to one of: PASS, WATCH, FAIL.
- If evaluation cannot be computed due to missing inputs: state = UNKNOWN (internal), and enforcement behaves fail-closed.

**Checks:**
- RUNTIME-A5-1: All trigger IDs are unique.
  - If duplicate: reason_code = CFO-13, outcome = REJECTED
- RUNTIME-A5-2: Trigger IDs referenced in gating_rules critical_triggers and gates must exist in trigger_spec.triggers.
  - If reference missing: reason_code = CFO-14, outcome = REJECTED
- RUNTIME-A5-3: Each trigger declares measurement cadence compatible with trigger_spec.measurement_cadence categories (daily/weekly/monthly_close).
  - If trigger requires cadence not listed: reason_code = CFO-15, outcome = REJECTED

#### A5.2 Required Runtime Inputs by Trigger (Minimum)
To compute triggers, the Worker MUST require the following minimum inputs per evaluation cycle:

- T1 (FCF trajectory): OperatingCashFlow, Capex, TargetFCF_3mo_avg(month_index), month_index
- T2 (EBITDA trajectory): Revenue, COGS, Opex excl D&A, TargetEBITDA_3mo_avg(month_index), month_index
- T3 (Ro40): ARR_Growth_Rate_TTM, EBITDA_Margin_TTM
- T4 (Runway): CashBalance, NetBurn_3mo_avg (or components to derive), and burn nonzero guard
- T5 (NRR): StartingARR, Expansion, Contraction, Churn
- T6 (Pipeline coverage): QualifiedPipelineAmount_next_quarter, BookingsTarget_next_quarter
- T7 (CAC payback): CAC, GrossMargin, NewARR_per_month
- T8 (Gross margin): Revenue, COGS

**Checks:**
- RUNTIME-A5-4: If any required input for a CRITICAL trigger (T1, T4, T5, T8) is missing at evaluation time:
  - reason_code = CFO-16, outcome = NEEDS_INPUT
- RUNTIME-A5-5: If any required input for a NON-critical trigger is missing:
  - reason_code = CFO-17, outcome = NEEDS_INPUT

### A6. Tranche Gating: Allowed/Blocked Decisions (No Bypass)
The Worker MUST enforce gates exactly as specified in `gating_rules.gates`, with the principles:
- Fail-closed on critical guardrails
- Protect retention
- Reallocate before cutting
- Bands over points

#### A6.1 Gate Evaluation Order (Deterministic)
1) Evaluate all triggers -> states
2) Determine if any critical trigger is FAIL / WATCH
3) Apply gate rules (G1..G4) in ascending gate_id order
4) Apply exceptions only if explicitly defined for that gate
5) Apply escalation rules after gate decisions are computed

**Checks:**
- RUNTIME-A6-1: `gating_rules.signal_states` must contain PASS, WATCH, FAIL exactly (order irrelevant).
  - If not: reason_code = CFO-18, outcome = REJECTED
- RUNTIME-A6-2: `gating_rules.critical_triggers` must be a subset of trigger IDs and non-empty.
  - If empty or invalid: reason_code = CFO-19, outcome = REJECTED

#### A6.2 Gate-Specific Enforcement (Exact)
**G1_HEADCOUNT**
- Allowed:
  - If all critical triggers PASS: proceed with approved plan; may add +1–2 critical roles/month only if Ro40 PASS AND CAC Payback PASS.
  - If any critical trigger WATCH: backfills only + retention-critical roles; CFO approval required.
- Blocked:
  - If any critical trigger FAIL: block all net-new hires and non-critical backfills; exception requires CEO+CFO signoff and written ROI case.
- Exception:
  - If T5 WATCH/FAIL: CS/Product roles directly mitigating churn are allowed even during containment, but MUST be offset by cuts elsewhere.

**Checks:**
- RUNTIME-A6-3: Any headcount request without explicit classification {retention-critical | non-critical | backfill | net-new}:
  - reason_code = CFO-20, outcome = NEEDS_INPUT
- RUNTIME-A6-4: Any headcount approval when any critical trigger FAIL and missing CEO+CFO signoff + ROI case:
  - reason_code = CFO-21, outcome = REJECTED

**G2_GTM_SPEND**
- Allowed:
  - If T7 PASS AND T6 PASS AND (T1 or T2) PASS/WATCH: scale +5–15% in proven segments; experiment budget capped 2–5% of GTM spend.
- Blocked:
  - If T7 FAIL or T6 FAIL: freeze scaling; cut lowest ROI channels 10–30%; require ROI proof for reinstatement.
  - If T1 FAIL AND T4 WATCH/FAIL: immediate discretionary GTM spend freeze except commitments; re-approve monthly.
- Required controls:
  - Discount governance by segment; CFO approval for exceptions
  - Quota capacity check alignment with coverage thresholds

**Checks:**
- RUNTIME-A6-5: Any GTM spend change request missing: segment, channel, amount, expected ROI/payback, and whether it is "experiment" vs "proven":
  - reason_code = CFO-22, outcome = NEEDS_INPUT
- RUNTIME-A6-6: Any discount exception without CFO approval:
  - reason_code = CFO-23, outcome = REJECTED

**G3_PRODUCT_AND_RND**
- Allowed:
  - If T5 PASS or WATCH: prioritize retention-critical roadmap; limit new big bets to quantified retention/upsell impact.
- Blocked:
  - If T1 FAIL and T5 PASS: pause non-core R&D; focus on cost-to-serve, reliability, upsell enablers.
  - If T5 FAIL: block any roadmap that risks churn; mandate churn-reduction tiger team and reliability focus.

**Checks:**
- RUNTIME-A6-7: Any roadmap initiative missing classification {retention-critical | non-core | big-bet} and quantified impact (retention/upsell):
  - reason_code = CFO-24, outcome = NEEDS_INPUT
- RUNTIME-A6-8: Any approval of a roadmap item flagged as “risks churn” while T5 FAIL:
  - reason_code = CFO-25, outcome = REJECTED

**G4_VENDOR_AND_NON_LABOR**
- Allowed:
  - If T1 PASS and T4 PASS: renewals allowed; new spend requires ROI case if >$5k/month.
- Blocked:
  - If T4 WATCH/FAIL: renegotiate top vendors; approve only mission-critical; target 10–20% savings within 60 days.

**Checks:**
- RUNTIME-A6-9: Any new vendor spend >$5k/month without ROI case:
  - reason_code = CFO-26, outcome = REJECTED
- RUNTIME-A6-10: Any vendor approval under T4 WATCH/FAIL without mission-critical justification:
  - reason_code = CFO-27, outcome = REJECTED

### A7. Defensive Mode (Fail-Closed Policy)
From outcome_contract.fail_closed_policy:
- Default: If any critical trigger is FAIL, system enters DEFENSIVE mode until two consecutive PASS cycles.

**Checks:**
- RUNTIME-A7-1: If any critical trigger FAIL:
  - enforce DEFENSIVE actions set:
    - Hiring freeze except retention-critical
    - Discretionary spend reduction 10–25%
    - Weekly cash focus and collections push
    - Reallocation of GTM spend to proven ROI or retention
  - If Worker attempts to remain in non-defensive mode: reason_code = CFO-28, outcome = REJECTED
- RUNTIME-A7-2: Exit criteria requires two consecutive cycles where all critical triggers PASS.
  - If exit attempted without meeting criteria: reason_code = CFO-29, outcome = REJECTED

### A8. Escalation Rules (Mandatory)
From gating_rules.escalation_rules:
- Two consecutive monthly FAILs on T1/T2 -> Board-level review; stronger cost program; revise guidance narrative
- Four consecutive weekly FAILs on T4 -> activate financing/strategic options; immediate burn reduction

**Checks:**
- RUNTIME-A8-1: If condition met and escalation not emitted as required event:
  - reason_code = CFO-30, outcome = REJECTED

### A9. Data Requirements & Quality SLA (Minimum Enforceable Set)
From outcome_contract.data_requirements:
- Systems: Accounting/ERP, CRM, Billing/Subscriptions, Data warehouse (if exists)
- Minimum fields: ARR bridge, COGS breakdown, Opex by function, Pipeline stages/targets, Headcount by function with fully-loaded cost assumptions
- SLA: close timeliness range [5,10] days; CRM hygiene enforced

**Checks:**
- RUNTIME-A9-1: If any minimum_fields are absent from available runtime dataset for monthly close evaluation:
  - reason_code = CFO-31, outcome = NEEDS_INPUT
- RUNTIME-A9-2: If monthly close is delivered outside SLA (>10 business days) and Worker is asked to certify trigger states as final:
  - reason_code = CFO-32, outcome = REJECTED
- RUNTIME-A9-3: If CRM hygiene required fields not enforced (missing stage definitions/required qualification fields) and pipeline triggers are used for gating:
  - reason_code = CFO-33, outcome = NEEDS_INPUT

### A10. No-Bypass Invariants (Hard Stops)
The following are absolute:
1) Any approval that violates a gate’s `blocked_if` is forbidden unless an explicit exception exists AND required signoffs are present.
2) Any attempt to approve discretionary growth spend or net-new headcount while any critical trigger is FAIL is forbidden (except explicit retention_protection exception for CS/Product roles, with offset requirement).
3) All approvals/denials must be logged with: request_id, gate_id, trigger_states, rationale, signoffs, expected ROI band.

**Checks:**
- RUNTIME-A10-1: Gate decision without decision log entry:
  - reason_code = CFO-34, outcome = REJECTED
- RUNTIME-A10-2: Retention_protection exception used without documented offset cuts:
  - reason_code = CFO-35, outcome = REJECTED

# Governance Publication Set — vsf-TEST-CFO-001

## What this is
A deterministic, versioned, commit-ready publication set for CFO governance decision authority:
- micro_case
- trigger_spec
- gating_rules
- outcome_contract
- runtime enforcement contract (included)

## Files
- 00_master_registry.yaml — registry and pointers
- 01_canonicalization_profile.json — deterministic normalization rules (units, thresholds)
- 02_hash_coverage_map.yaml — what must be hashed for enforcement integrity
- 03_fail_closed_mapping.yaml — fail-closed behavior mapping
- 04_compatibility_policy.yaml — semver and breaking-change rules
- 05_reference_graph_policy.yaml — reference integrity requirements
- 06_decision_package_taxonomy.yaml — artifact taxonomy
- 07_conformance_checklist.yaml — machine-checkable conformance checks
- 08_outcome_contract.json — bundled artifacts + enforcement contract pointer + schemas
- 09_design_conformance_report.yaml — publication conformance report

## Enforcement note
Runtime behavior is governed by the published Runtime Enforcement Contract v1:
- Missing required inputs => NEEDS_INPUT
- Parsing/shape/semantic invalidity => REJECTED
- Any critical FAIL/UNKNOWN => DEFENSIVE (fail-closed)

## Hashing
All hash fields are set to HASH_TODO and should be computed in CI using the hash coverage map.

# QA Gatekeeper Report — vsf-TEST-CFO-001

## Scope
This report records the QA outcome for the Git-ready publication package:
- Core CFO artifacts: micro_case, trigger_spec, gating_rules, outcome_contract
- Board memo draft
- Runtime enforcement contract
- Policy wrapper set (00..09 + README)

## Findings (ported from provided QA summary)
- Prior NO-GO reasons were tied to *presentation format* of pasted A–D blocks and language mix in the chat transcript.
- This publication package resolves those issues by:
  - Writing core artifacts as standalone JSON files in `docs/cfo_runs/...`
  - Keeping repository artifacts in English (file contents), with meta/notes handled outside files

## Structural checks (repository-level)
- Required core artifacts present: PASS
- Enforcement contract published: PASS
- Policy wrapper set published: PASS
- Index and QA files present: PASS

## Known runtime dependencies (not QA failures)
- T4 requires runtime CashBalance and NetBurn_3mo_avg inputs.
- T1/T2 require runtime target trajectory inputs (TargetFCF_3mo_avg / TargetEBITDA_3mo_avg by month_index).
- Hash fields remain HASH_TODO pending CI.

D) Index file content
(Already provided above as docs/index/vsf-TEST-CFO-001.md.)

QA GATE (CZ)
	•	Repo layout: PASS (všechny předepsané cesty existují).
	•	Jazyková politika: PASS (obsah souborů EN; META/poznámky zde CZ).
	•	JSON/YAML čistota: PASS (žádný frontmatter v JSON/YAML; frontmatter pouze v MD).
	•	Hash politika: PASS (HASH_TODO ponecháno pro CI).
	•	Poznámka: Původní QA NO-GO (CFO-08 / CH-01) bylo vázáno na formát chat paste; tato publikace jej obchází uložením artefaktů do souborů.

NEXT ACTIONS (CZ)
1. Doplnit CI krok pro výpočet hashů dle 02_hash_coverage_map.yaml a vyplnění HASH_TODO.
2. Implementovat threshold parser dle 01_canonicalization_profile.json a napojit na runtime validátor.
3. Zpřísnit runtime vstupní schémata pro requesty G1/G2/G3/G4 (eliminace CFO-20/22/24).
4. Přidat perzistentní počítání “consecutive FAILs” pro eskalace (CFO-30) s audit trail.
5. Zajistit, aby TargetFCF_3mo_avg(month_index) / TargetEBITDA_3mo_avg(month_index) byly definované jako runtime input (jinak standardně NEEDS_INPUT).
