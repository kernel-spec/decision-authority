Board Decision Package: Breakeven in 12 Months Without Breaking the Growth Narrative

Company: B2B SaaS (~$9M ARR, ~74% gross margin)
Decision Date: 2026-02-23
Sponsor: CFO
Audience: Board, CEO, Exec Team

1) Executive Summary

We will reach breakeven within 12 months using a governed, trigger-based operating system that preserves the growth narrative through explicit guardrails on retention and pipeline health. The plan shifts the company from “growth at any cost” to “efficient growth,” using Rule of 40 and leading indicators to support external credibility while we tighten spend and improve unit economics.

What we are asking the Board to approve today
	1.	Adopt FCF breakeven as the primary definition (with EBITDA as a secondary lens).
	2.	Approve the trigger + gating system (fail-closed) that automatically constrains hiring and discretionary spend when critical signals degrade.
	3.	Approve a phased execution plan:
	•	Phase 1 (0–30 days): stop-the-bleed + instrumentation + fast savings
	•	Phase 2 (31–120 days): GTM efficiency + retention lift + pricing discipline
	•	Phase 3 (121–365 days): scale what works within gated budgets to land at breakeven

Outcome
	•	Breakeven (FCF and/or EBITDA) by month 12 using ranges (no false precision)
	•	Maintain credible growth story via guardrails: NRR floor, pipeline coverage, gross margin, and Rule of 40 trend

2) Context and Mandate

The Board mandate is clear: achieve breakeven in 12 months without undermining the growth narrative. For a ~$9M ARR SaaS at ~74% GM, the path is operationally feasible if we:
	•	Protect retention and product quality (prevent revenue leakage)
	•	Improve GTM efficiency (better payback, tighter ICP)
	•	Rationalize spend with disciplined gates (no ad-hoc cuts that harm the long-term)

3) Breakeven Definition and Reporting

We propose FCF breakeven as the primary definition because it reflects cash reality. However, cash can be volatile due to collections and working capital timing, so we will also report EBITDA breakeven as a consistent operating view.

Definition (FCF): 3-month average of (Operating Cash Flow – Capex) ≥ 0
Definition (EBITDA): 3-month average EBITDA ≥ 0
We will manage to a trajectory with bands (e.g., within ±$40–$50k of target band is considered on-track).

4) Operating System: Triggers and Gates (Fail-Closed)

We will run the company with explicit triggers (formulas + thresholds + windows + pass/fail actions). The system is designed to fail-closed: if critical triggers fail, the company automatically shifts into defensive mode until two consecutive PASS cycles.

Critical guardrails (non-negotiable)
	•	Runway floor (>= 15 months target band; < 12 months = FAIL)
	•	Retention floor (NRR >= 105% target band; < 100% = FAIL)
	•	Gross margin floor (>= 72% target band; < 70% = FAIL)
	•	Breakeven trajectory (FCF or EBITDA 3-mo avg vs target band)

Growth narrative guardrails
	•	Rule of 40: keep trend >= ~30% band where feasible
	•	Pipeline coverage: maintain >= ~3.0x next-quarter coverage band
	•	CAC payback: stay within <= ~15 months band; failing segments are cut or reworked

What gates do
	•	Hiring gate: net-new headcount allowed only when critical triggers are PASS; otherwise backfills only (and retention-critical exceptions)
	•	GTM spend gate: scale only where pipeline + payback are healthy; otherwise cut lowest ROI channels and tighten qualification
	•	Product/R&D gate: protect retention-critical roadmap; pause non-core initiatives during cost stress
	•	Vendor gate: renegotiate and constrain non-labor spend if runway deteriorates

5) Plan of Record: 3 Phases

Phase 1 (0–30 days): Stop-the-bleed + Instrumentation

Goals: immediate cost control without harming retention; establish metrics, definitions, and cadence.
Actions:
	•	Implement trigger dashboard and weekly operating review
	•	Freeze non-essential spend; require ROI for new vendors >$5k/month
	•	Identify 10–20% discretionary savings from tools, contractors, and low-ROI marketing tests
	•	Confirm baseline: burn, runway, ARR bridge, GM drivers, churn reasons

Deliverable: Board-ready baseline model (base/downside/upside) with variance bands.

Phase 2 (31–120 days): GTM Efficiency + Retention + Pricing Discipline

Goals: improve unit economics and reduce revenue leakage; preserve growth narrative via leading indicators.
Actions:
	•	Tighten ICP, enforce qualification, rebalance SDR/AE capacity to pipeline reality
	•	Reduce discounting variance; implement pricing/packaging governance
	•	Launch churn war-room if NRR trends toward WATCH/FAIL
	•	Drive CAC payback down through conversion improvements and segment focus
	•	Infra/COGS optimization roadmap to protect GM

Deliverable: demonstrated improvements in payback, pipeline coverage, and NRR trajectory.

Phase 3 (121–365 days): Scale Within Gates to Land at Breakeven

Goals: selective reinvestment in proven channels and product initiatives; reach breakeven by month 12.
Actions:
	•	Scale only segments/channels with PASS on payback and coverage
	•	Invest in expansion motions where NRR supports it
	•	Maintain defensive readiness: if triggers fail, automatically constrain spend/hiring

Deliverable: breakeven achieved with stable retention and credible growth narrative metrics.

6) Key Risks and Mitigations
	1.	Retention erosion from cost actions
	•	Mitigation: retention floor trigger; protect CS/Product capacity; churn war-room.
	2.	Pipeline shortfall jeopardizes growth narrative
	•	Mitigation: pipeline coverage trigger; re-segment; focus spend on proven ROI.
	3.	Cash volatility masks underlying trend
	•	Mitigation: use 3-month averages; pair EBITDA with runway trigger; stress cases.
	4.	Over-cutting reduces future growth capacity
	•	Mitigation: gates allow selective investment when PASS; keep a capped experiment budget.
	5.	Data quality/definitions cause “false signals”
	•	Mitigation: data SLA; enforce CRM hygiene; standard metric definitions in outcome contract.

7) Decisions Required Today
	1.	Approve FCF breakeven as primary definition (EBITDA as secondary).
	2.	Approve the trigger thresholds (bands) and fail-closed gating rules.
	3.	Approve the operating cadence and owner accountability model.
	4.	Approve Phase 1 actions (instrumentation + immediate discretionary savings + vendor controls).

8) What the Board Should Expect Next
	•	Weekly dashboard highlights (runway, pipeline, spend vs budget)
	•	Monthly close package: trigger status, forecast ranges (base/downside/upside), gate exception log
	•	Quarterly: trajectory vs breakeven plan, efficiency narrative (Rule of 40, NRR, CAC payback)
